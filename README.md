# Sigma File Extension (SFE)

The Sigma File Extension is a alternative to PNG. It offeres a unique and open source tool for creating and converting images from and to PNG.

## TODO

1. Work on a more user friendly method to convert images
2. Work on making it possible to view SFE files
3. Convert to tauri later down the road when it's almost complete
4. Add a GitHub workflow to compile and release SFE automatically or when needed
