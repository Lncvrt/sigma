# Sigma File Extension (SFE)

The Sigma File Extension is a alternative to PNG. It offeres a unique and open source tool for creating and converting images from and to PNG.

## TODO

1. Work on a more user friendly method to convert images
2. Work on making it possible to view SFE files
3. Convert to tauri later down the road when it's almost complete
